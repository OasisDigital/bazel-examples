# From the rules_go documentation:

# "Note that go build won't be aware of dependencies listed in WORKSPACE,
# so you may want to download your dependencies into your GOPATH or module
# cache so that your tools are aware of them. You may also need to check
# in generated files."

# Thus: go get github.com/mattn/go-slim

# However, suitable IDE/tooling integration can instead make the
# Bazel-loaded dependencies available for IDE use.
